		<h1>Steve Stone</h1>
		<p>I am southwest through and through.  Born in Albuquerque on February 26, 1979.
			I have spent most of my life living in New Mexico but I have lived in a few other states.
			These include Texas, Colorado, Montana and Alaska.</p>
		<p>One of my goals I am trying to achieve is to complete an ultra-marathon.  If you are not familiar with
			an ultra-marathon it is any distance that is longer than 26 miles.  I started on this goal last year
			but I injured my hip before I was able to reach my goal</p>
